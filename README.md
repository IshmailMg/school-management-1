Group members entity assignment is as follows: <br>
-Sinenhlanhla Zondi (220008922): Address & City <br>
-Nonzwakazi Mgxaji (213181584): Country <br>
-Fayaad Abrahams (218221630) : Employee & Name <br>
-Ishmail Tafadzwa Mgwena (215088417): Employee Address <br>
-Sinazo Mehlomakhulu (216076498): Student Address <br>
-Shina Kara (219333181): Student <br><br>

Improvements: <br>
-the entities are too simplistic with their attributes. It would have been better if 
there were more attributes of different types (LocalDateTime, String, int, long). <br>
-the IDs of some entities (studentId for example) would have worked better in type 
long. This is suitable since it works better with the automatically generating/incrementing. Having 
IDs in type String would have worked if this diagram was about an application that involved usernames.<br>
-another improvement would be the relationship types between entities. It would have been better to have
entities with a many-to-many, zero-to-many etc. association. <br>
